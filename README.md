*Original project built from scratch.*

This is a password generator with standard input validation standards that stores a created password in the cloud. 
It authenticates and validates your Google credentials to gain access to a Google Sheet called "PasswordLog" where your new password will be stored
by time, domain, and generated new password. 

* IMPORTANT * You will need to create a Google Cloud Console - Service Account - in order to download your credentials to a .json file where you will store it in the
same directory as the .py program to run. Be sure to name your credentials file "credentials.json" so that the program can find it automatically and pull
your credentials to authenticate and gain access to the Gsheet.

Thank you
